I am a Ph.D. candidate in the interdiciplary area of statistical/machine learning and econometric study. I am experienced in establishing theoretical statistical models and evaluating empirical econometric studies. More specifically, applying Bayesian & frequentist models with dynamic programming to aid decision making for complex/data based financial activities has been my research interest since undergraduate school.

# Interests in Statistics
As a statistical researcher, my principal interest lies in the field of Bayesian inference and variable selection in supervised learning studies. I used to explore the re-parameterized Bayesian model, such as spike & slab prior. These unusual model comes with good mathematical properties but difficult to evaluate analytically. To conquer the computational limitation, I used MCMC with the Metropolis-Hastings process to recover the asymptotic probability model. In this process, I began to develop interests in high-performance computation. 

# Interests in Econometrics
As an economic researcher, I am interested in applying novel statistical approaches to test causality and achieve optimization under the classical quantitative theoretical framework. Based on this interest, I am currently undertaking my Ph.D. on the study of evaluation algorithms to help make risk-controlled and efficient investment decisions, in medium to big size data. Following this, I hope to establish financial indicators/systems to detect and, most importantly, predict investment/risk alert signals in daily information processing activities, which potentially can be beneficial to government sectors, the central bank, corporate governors, researchers, and other stakeholders.

# Publication as Data Scientist
I participate in the Alan Turing Institute Data Study Group to gain experience in different sub-areas in machine learning.
 (1) **Social science** Collaborating with UK Cabinet Office, we utilize data to provide a more detailed picture of an individual's engagement with extremism to identify both the risk factors of radicalization and potential points for intervention, with a paper published in private channel.

(2) **AI ethics** Collaborating with Accenture AI specialists, we propose quantifying AI fairness with 5 different proxies and implement a set of algorithms to detect the potential biases of current dataset to eliminate the disparate impact of unfair data, which is shown as a well-performed framework to help AI-related companies to improve their work to maintain fairness during data-based decision-making process under the upcoming GDPR, with research paper published publicly.

(3) **Cybersecurity** Collaborating with IC, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and The Heilbronn Institute for Mathematical Research to develop data science tools for improving enterprise cyber-security. My contribution is to apply unsupervised learning in unusual change detection in the 'blend-in attack' of information fusion research. 

(4) **Cybernetics in real case** Collaborating with National Air Traffic Services, we developed a series of machine learning/deep learning methods to predict air traffic trajectories (high-frequency time series data). My role is to help understand the linear dynamic control theory and Kalman filter.
