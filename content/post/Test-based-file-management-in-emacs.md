People discuss the most efficient way text management methods for a number of reasons. Someone wants to build an digitalized notebooks for new
knowledge. Someone wants to manage the increasing case files in office work.
Someone wants to review thousands of articles they hoard on internet. Either
way, I call that 'text digesting system' and buckle up, I got MANY opinion on this topic.

I think we have all been drenched in various tools, some excel at
surpporting markdown, some are good at coding highlighting, some surpport
real-time online collaboration or even text searching in images. If one haven't used Emacs, I would probably
recommend Evernote or Onenote. But softwares like them has glitches when there
are thousand files to manage. For example, the most frequent way to manage files
is using categories and tags (or tweaked as pages/binders/ect.) The limitation
is category is that you can only allocate an articles ONCE. The tags seem to
help this limitation, and yet I noticed it's still not enough in practicle work.
The most frequent and efficient way is to use `global search` , which brings my
opinion: `the allocation of an arcicle should be decided by the whole arcicle,
instead of two or three words.`

Emacs org-mode solves other issues:
• How to take note: speech input in org-mode
• How to memorize knowledge: Anki + Anki-editor
• How to classify: categories and tags
• How to search: helm-ag + regex
• How to visualize structure:
