When I review the prove of the most foundamental knowledge of ANOVA test, I
notice that the notation is not quite consistent across different materials,
especially for non-balanced dataset expression. Some of the prove of SST=SSE+SSB
is missing steps or gets too complex in polynomial expansions. So here I provide
a note with full proof with consistent notations.
