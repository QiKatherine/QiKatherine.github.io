I have used flash card for remembering new thing for years. Before using softwares like org-drill or Anki, Iwas pretty much putting everything in slides, printing on papers and cutting it into portable sized card and carried in my pocket. So I have been exploring an ultimate solution of perfect formatting for everything. This picture shows what I feel about slides making tools.

I always thought math functions display tricky but the Latex with Beamer has provided an adequaltely good template for most people. As a comparison the code highlighting is tricker, especially for not-so-prevalent proggramming languages like Lisp. In order to properly demonstrate code highlighting, sometimes people have to paster code in Notepad++ with designated formatting, then paste into MS word, then to MS power point. Or take an alternative hustle to explore various online highlighting transformation tool. If you are looking for a long term hustless solution, then I think "Emacs/Spacemacs + Org-mode + org-reveal" makes a great tool for you.
