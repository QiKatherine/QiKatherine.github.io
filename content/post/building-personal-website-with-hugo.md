This is a minimum todo list for one to use a static website generator to build a
personal website. The are a number of them such as Jekyll, Hexo, Octopress, World press,
Hugo, etc. I have tried all of the above and personally prefer Hugo for speed and
flexibility and compatibility with my Emacs.

If you are interested in building a personal wiki, academic profile, home
cooking recipe album, small business official website, building and managing a
website by these types of generator facilitates you with most flexibility with the
minimum cost.

By most flexibility, I mean you can change the look of your website any time
with a number of fantastic designs, and upload articles/photo whenever you want.

By minimum expenditure, I mean zero cost, unless you want to get a customized
website name like _awesome.ai_ or rent some cloud based services to boost up
your website.

To do:


## 1. Register a GitHub account and install local terminal. {#1-dot-register-a-github-account-and-install-local-terminal-dot}

[An Intro to Git and GitHub for Beginners (Tutorial)](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)

This is where you host your website for others to visit with the minimum cost. Purchasing personal server/VPS, using Gitlab or other cloud based service has its own benefit, but requires some more work or expenditure.

Installing local terminal to push your local edited website content to remote
server. For example, if you are using Windows, install git bash from: [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)


## 2. Download Hugo executable. {#2-dot-download-hugo-executable-dot}

The full instruction is here to all systems users:
[Install Hugo | Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)

If you are a proficient command line user of Linux/macOS, homebrew it!

If you are a windows user and not sure which one to follow, the video in above
link should be sufficient, the link he talks about is in _Less-technical Users_ section. But make sure you update the environment variable. This
is where your git bash could find the Hugo binary and access to it.
